[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### The first skeleton (early; nothing is released yet)
- A project folder (`soundclaw new`): `sounds/`, `instruments/`, `songs/`, `sets/`, a history tape
  with authors (`agent:<name>`, `human:<name>`), `requests.jsonl`, and `exports/` ignored by git.
- The single writer: `soundclaw run <project> <file|->` applies a batch of commands as one undo
  group, and any error applies nothing. `undo`, `redo` and `history`.
- A placeholder voice: `sound new <id>` and `sound set <id> frequency= duration= volume=` make a
  sine tone, so the plumbing is real end to end.
- A deterministic pure-TypeScript renderer (44,100 Hz mono `Float32Array`; the same samples in Node
  and in the browser), 16-bit WAV export, and a content-hash render cache.
- `soundclaw serve`: MCP over stdio, HTTP and WebSocket, token and lock files, and the dashboard
  (sound cards with a play button, waveform, status, and the history).
- Requests: "Ask for changes" and "Approve" on a card; `soundclaw await` (exits with events) and the
  MCP `await_requests`; `soundclaw work list|claim|progress|block|done` and the MCP `work`.
- Per-command `--help` and `--version`; a Claude Code skill (`soundclaw skill install`).
